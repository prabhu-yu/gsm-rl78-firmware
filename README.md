# gsm-rl78-firmware

- This is a firmware for RL78-GSM interface board.  
- I have written C code to interface with GSM AT modem, onboard flash to store the user data.
- It laso has I2C RTC DS1307/DS3231 Interface. i.e, when GSM is down due ( ex: no-currency ), product can still function the time based work using local RTC.
- USe Renesas<sup>TM<sup> E<sup>2<sup> Studio for compilation of the code.

Thanks,
